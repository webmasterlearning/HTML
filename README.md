This is a learning program that anyone can use to learn more about creating and editing content online. It walks you through a hands-on approach to learning and using basic web development technologies: how to learn it and what tools can be used for it.

This is a free resource translated in many languages intended to provide emerging developers with learning materials and tools to create great content online.

The content covers web technologies (HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript) and those solutions that are directly built on top of these open technologies.

The material should not be considered a comprehensive list of all resources available to a webmaster but rather a hands-on introduction to basic technologies.

The learning program is divided into four parts.
