Learn HTML is an introduction to HTML. In this lesson, you will learn how to use the basics of HTML.
This is a learning program that anyone can use to learn more about creating and editing content online. It walks you through a hands-on approach to learning and using basic web development technologies: how to learn it and what tools can be used for it.

This is a free resource translated in many languages intended to provide emerging developers with learning materials and tools to create great content online. The content covers web technologies (HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript).
